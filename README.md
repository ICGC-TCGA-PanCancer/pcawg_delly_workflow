# DELLY Workflow for Pan Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG)

The workflow consists of two main workflows:

- *DELLY* variant calling

- *COV* Coverage analysis

## [DELLY](https://github.com/tobiasrausch/delly)

DELLY is an integrated structural variant prediction method that can detect deletions, tandem duplications, inversions and translocations at single-nucleotide resolution in short-read massively parallel sequencing data. It uses paired-ends and split-reads to sensitively and accurately delineate genomic rearrangements throughout the genome.

## COV

Genome-wide coverage analysis and Depth of Coverage plotting, comparing tumor-normal
